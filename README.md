# Live Weather App

A React-based weather app that gives real-time weather info using the WeatherAPI.com service.

## Architecture

### Key Components

- **App** (`src/App.jsx`): Main component that manages application state (`weather` and `error` states) 
- **SearchForm** (`src/components/SearchForm.jsx`): Handles user input and search validation
- **WeatherInfo** (`src/components/WeatherInfo.jsx`): Displays weather information with fallback to default data
- **weatherApi** (`src/services/weatherApi.js`): Fatches weather data from API and data processing

### Data Flow Example: Searching for "Dallas"

1. Webpage is displayed with the App component, SearchForm is displayed
2. User types "Dallas" in the search box and submits the form in **SearchForm**.
3. The `onSearch` prop is called with "Dallas" as the argument.
4. The **App** component's `handleSearch` function is triggered.
5. `handleSearch` calls `fetchWeather("Dallas")` from the API service.
6. `fetchWeather` makes an HTTP request to WeatherAPI.com and processes the response.
7. The processed weather data is stored in the App's state.
8. The **WeatherInfo** component receives the new weather data as a prop from **App**.
9. **WeatherInfo** renders the weather details for Dallas (temperature, location, condition, wind speed, humidity).

## Setup and Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to confirm

4. To build project for production (dist folder):
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. Deploy to github pages (gh-pages branch defined in package.json)
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
- What it does automatically:
    1. **Creates a `gh-pages` branch** (or switches to existing one)
    2. **Clears the branch** and copies your `dist/` files to it
    3. **Commits the files** with a deploy message
    4. **Pushes to GitHub** on the `gh-pages` branch
    5. **Switches back** to your original branch

6. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:
- Go to Settings â†’ Pages
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: gh-pages
- Folder: / (root)
- Click Save
- Your app will be live at: https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name
